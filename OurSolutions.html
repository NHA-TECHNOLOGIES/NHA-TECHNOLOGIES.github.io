                    <h2></h2>
                    <p>Hospital information systems (HIS) are computer systems designed to ease the management of all the
                        hospital’s medical and administrative information and to improve the quality of health care.
                        A HIS is an integrated system by vocation (i.e. within the hospital and with the outside environment),
                        that could also be called integrated hospital information and communication system (HICS). Hospital
                        information systems have for main objectives to improve the quality and continuity of care by
                        standardising medical processes, help decision making, reduce professional errors, improve outcomes
                        and equally reduce costs by optimising processes, reduce administrative overhead, reduce the length of 
                        impatient stays and facilitate strategic decisions. We therefore will be a reliable partner to healthcare
                        facilities and organisations in ensuring that they become as paperless as possible and guide them
                        towards executing and implementing HIS for their healthcare facilities. </p>

                    <p>
                        The Electronic Health Record (EHR) is a digital compilation of health-related information adhering to recognized interoperability standards. It is accessible to authorized clinicians across multiple healthcare organizations. With the increasing use of Information Technology, hospitals are shifting from paper-based patient records to EHRs. The primary objective of EHRs is to enhance healthcare processes, facilitating data reuse for research, decreasing access times, enabling data sharing, ensuring security, and preventing medical errors. Despite the challenges in implementing EHRs in healthcare facilities in Cameroon and across the continent, the goal is a complete transition from paper-based to electronic health records, driven by determination to revolutionize healthcare processes.</p>

                    <p>A clinical decision support system is an application that analyses data to help healthcare providers make
                        decisions and improve patient care. It is a health information technology that provides clinicians, staff,
                        patients, and other individuals with knowledge and person-specific information to help health and
                        healthcare. They can be used across care settings, specialties and pathways to improve healthcare
                        delivery and reduce errors. We will ensure that we aid healthcare providers in Cameroon and across the
                        continent to implement and use these clinical decision support systems so as to deliver accurate, timely

                    <p>Telemedicine (as defined by the WHO, enables “the delivery of health care services, where distance is a
                        critical factor, by all health care professionals using information and communication technologies for the
                        exchange of valid information for diagnosis, treatment and prevention of disease and injuries, research
                        and evaluation, and for the continuing education of health care providers”. In fact, telemedicine is
                        telehealth performed by the medical professional. A good number of health facilities and health
                        personnel across the continent are still lacking when it comes to using and applying telemedicine to
                        support and ameliorate clinical practice. Hence we are committed to developing user friendly and
                        reliable telemedicine solutions for healthcare facilities with respect to the peculiarities and needs of each
                        of them across the continent and facilitate their effective application and usage in ameliorating and
                        optimising clinical practice.</p>
